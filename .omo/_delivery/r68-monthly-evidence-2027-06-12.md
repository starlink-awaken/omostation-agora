## R68 deliverables checklist

## Check script verdict

```
Condition 1: ≥3 projects use bus-foundation or agora.bus     PASS (6 projects)
Condition 2: ≥180 days git history                            PASS (4 commits in 180 days)
Condition 3: CLAUDE.md documents owner                        PASS
Condition 4: ≥1 eCOS-external user (proxy ≥5 internal)        PASS (6 internal)
Condition 5: commit freq ≥ 50% of agora                       FAIL (23.53% — needs 6+ months history)
```

**4/5 PASS** at R68 close. Condition 5 will tick monthly as bus-foundation
accumulates commit history. Phase B (R66-R69) gate is satisfied; Phase C
(L0 promotion) requires Condition 5 to reach ≥50% over 6 months.

## Public API freeze

0.1.0 public API is **frozen for 6 months** (per ADR-0008.1). Any breaking
change requires an ADR + 2 maintainer approvals.

## Next month (R69)

Cross-repo e2e gate: `bus-foundation/tests/test_cross_repo_smoke.py` +
run all 7 consumer test suites + agora meta-test confirming agora.bus
re-exports from bus_foundation.
