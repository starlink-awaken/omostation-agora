# bus-foundation Phase C: DEFER (one-line pointer)

> Date: 2026-06-12 (committed as 2027-09-12 per R-series naming)

**Phase C evaluation closed: Path C (Defer Indefinitely).**
bus-foundation stays as a standalone repo at `projects/bus-foundation/`,
not promoted to L0 protocol layer at `protocols/bus-foundation/`.

Full retrospective and 3-path analysis:
`projects/bus-foundation/.omo/_delivery/r72-final-retrospective-2027-09-12.md`
and `projects/bus-foundation/docs/ADR-0002-phase-c-trigger-reality-DRAFT.md`.

agora.bus continues to exist as a backward-compat alias / premium-backend
shim. New code imports from `bus_foundation` (zero agora dep).
